Current limitations:
- Random crashes when the keyboard is unplugged and plugged back in
- No uninstallation (except by rebooting the calc)
- Ctrl and/or CAPS modifiers are strangely always displayed, and not taken into account
- No key repeat for most keys
- Partial key mapping. Some AZERTY keys cannot be mapped, language mapping shouldn't be applied on USB Usage ID.
- No LED support
