# This file defines all the images loaded by the game
# They are assigned in a static array and limited to 128 images by default
#
# If you need to re-assign the upper limit, you need to edit IMAGE_COUNT
# field in config.h and recompile the game

# Syntax to define an image
# [image_number] [image_file_path] [alpha]
# Alpha has to be set to 0 all the time, unless your image has
# a transparency layer in which case you have to set alpha to 1

# Make sure the image number you enter here DO NOT interfere with those
# define in the bitmap image ressource definition file !!!
