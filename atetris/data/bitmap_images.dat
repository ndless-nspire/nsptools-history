# This file defines all the images loaded by the game
# They are assigned in a static array and limited to 128 images by default
#
# If you need to re-assign the upper limit, you need to edit IMAGE_COUNT
# field in config.h and recompile the game

# Syntax to define an image
# [image_number] [image_file_path] [RGB transparency key colour]

# Also, note that all bright pink colours will be used for the transparency colour key
# This means RGB colour [255, 0, 255] will be transparent in game
