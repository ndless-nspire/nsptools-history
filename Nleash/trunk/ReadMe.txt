=============================
= Nleash v1.0 for TI-Nspire =
=============================

What is it?
===========

You have updated your TI-Nspire to the latest OS v2.1. Great.
But for some reason (good or bad, it depends on the point of view) you cannot
downgrade to version below 1.7 anymore.

Nleash puts you back in control.

How do I use it?
================

First make sure OS v2.1 is installed on your TI-Nspire.

Choose the right 'nleash.tns' file for your TI-Nspire model and send it as a
document with your favorite linking program. Bring up the documents screen on
the TI-Nspire and open the document.

The screen freezes for a few seconds, the calculator reboots, and freezes again
on the message "Loading Operating System..." for half a minute. You will then
see the message "Operating System not found. Install OS now."

Pick up the OS version of your choice (the authors recommend the great but
undangered OS v1.1) and do whatever *you* want to do.

Additional Information
======================

TouchPad TI-Nspires can be downgraded to OS 1.x with the help of Nleash and a
non-CAS ClickPad. Nleash must be run for every OS 2.0 to 1.x downgrade on these
models.

Troubleshooting
===============

If the calculator freezes or reboots with the original OS, you have probably
missed something. Check the versions of both Nleash and the OS.

If the TI-Nspire becomes unusable:
 * Enter the maintenance menu by rebooting it while holding the keys
   ON+Home+Enter+P until half the progress bar. To reboot the TI-Nspire, unplug
   the USB cable, then remove and put back the a battery.
 * Select '2' to uninstall the current OS. Reinstall it when asked to.
