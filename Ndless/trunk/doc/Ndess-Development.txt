      =================================


This document is intended for maintainers of Ndless.

This file describes the prerequisites and setup steps for a Windows development environment
to build Ndless.

You *don't* need to follow this procedure to set up a C/ARM development environment to
build TI-Nspire programs. This setup is described in ReadMe.txt.

C
=

- MSYS with MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys
- 7-zip: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

* Add 7-zip's folder to your PATH environment variable
* Copy Ndless/Makefile.config.tpl to Ndless/Makefile.config and configure the latter

ARM
===

- Set up the toolchain as described in ReadMe.txt. Ndless is built with itself, and
  you may not be able to use a previous version of Ndless to build it.
  You thus need to build the toolchain (cd tools && make) and add the bin/ directory
  at the root of the project to the PATH environment variable.

Building
========

From Ndless root directory:

* make: builds the artifacts
* make arm [NSPIRE_HARDWARE=CAS|NON_CAS, default is NON_CAS]: builds the ARM artifacts
* make dist: builds the artificats and create a release directory (dist)
* make distbin: incremental dist during development

Generating the syscalls header files
====================================

The syscalls header files for the different OS are generated.
This generated files are ditributed with Ndless's source code.

To regenerate these files, run the following command:
cd tools/Makesyscalls && make
