      =================================

This file describes the prerequisites and setup steps for a Windows development environment
to build Ndless.

C
=

- MSYS with MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys

* Copy Ndless/Makefile.config.tpl to Ndless/Makefile.config and configure the latter

ARM
===

- Set up the toolchain as described in ReadMe.xt

Java
====

- Java JDK 6 - http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - http://www.eclipse.org/downloads
- Subclipse (SVN plug-in for Eclipse) - http://subclipse.tigris.org/
- Apache Ant - http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
- ProGuard - http://proguard.sourceforge.net/
- TI Computer Link Software >= 1.4 - http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_nspire_computerlink.html

* Add Apache Ant's home directory to your PATH environment variable
* Unzip ProGuard to Ndles/java/tools/proguard (there will be bin/ and README in this directory)
* Import in Eclipse the Java Project Ndless/java
* Edit with a text editor Ndlessjava/Ndless.userlibraries, and configure the paths depending
  on your environment
* Load this file in Eclipse : Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> User Libraries
  -> Import
* Copy Ndless/java/build_config.properties.tpl to Ndless/java/build_config.properties and
  configure the latter
* Edit Ndless/java/ndless.pro and adapt the libraryjars paths

Building
========

From Ndless root directory:

* make: builds the artifacts
* make arm [NSPIRE_HARDWARE=CAS|NON_CAS, default is NON_CAS]: builds the ARM artifacts
* make dist FAST=true: builds the artificats and create a release directory (dist) for
  development tests. Java obfuscation is disabled.
* make dist: builds the artificats and create a release directory (dist)

Debugging the installer
=======================

The Eclipse Debug configuration should be configured this way:
* Arguments -> Working directory -> Other -> <dist in Ndless root directory>
* Classpath -> User Entries: The Computer Link User Library must be removed
  to use the version patched at runtime. choose Remove, then Add Projects -> Ndless
