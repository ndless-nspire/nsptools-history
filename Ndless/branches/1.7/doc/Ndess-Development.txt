      =================================


This document is intended for maintainers of Ndless.

This file describes the prerequisites and setup steps for a Windows development environment
to build Ndless.

You *don't* need to follow this procedure to set up a C/ARM development environment to
build TI-Nspire programs. This setup is described in ReadMe.txt.

C
=

- MSYS with MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys
- 7-zip: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

* Add 7-zip's folder to your PATH environment variable

ARM
===

- Set up the toolchain as described in ReadMe.txt. You will need a previous version of Ndless
  since the build chain of Ndless relies on itself.

Building
========

From Ndless root directory:

* make: builds the artifacts
* make arm [NSPIRE_HARDWARE=CAS|NON_CAS, default is NON_CAS]: builds the ARM artifacts
* make dist: builds the artificats and create a release directory (dist)
* make distbin: incremental dist during development
